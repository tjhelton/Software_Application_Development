//: ## String Interpolation
//: In Swift, you can define a string with placeholders that get replaced with values. It works a lot like “fill in the blanks” like this example from the previous page:
//:
//: “Hello _______, welcome to _______!”
//:
//: You don't use blank spaces as placeholders in Swift. You use `\(name)`. The value of `name` replaces the placeholder.
//:
//: Here it is in action. Notice in the results sidebar that the values of firstName and city are filled in:
let firstName = "Tim"
let city = "Cupertino"

let welcomeString = "Hello \(firstName), welcome to \(city)"
//: - experiment: Create your own string describing your favorite food.\
//: “I like _____ because it is _____.”
//:
// Change this to your favorite food
let favoriteFood = "pie"

// Change this to why you like it
let reason = "tasty"

// Define a string below in the pattern "I like ___ because it is ___."
let str = "I like " + favoriteFood + " because it is " + reason
